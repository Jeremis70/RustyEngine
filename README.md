## Description

RustyEngine is a modern game engine written in Rust, designed to be both high-performance and memory-safe.

The goal of this project is to build a clean, modular engine core that can be used directly in Rust and later exposed through Python bindings, allowing games to be developed with a simple and ergonomic Python API while keeping performance-critical systems in Rust.

The engine focuses on a clear architecture, strong safety guarantees, and modern graphics and audio APIs, aiming to provide an efficient and practical foundation for building games and interactive applications.
